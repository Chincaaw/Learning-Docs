# Typescript-Learning-Docs

This repository contains documentation of all my learning experiences about Typescript from the online course at @freeCodeCamp.org.

## Data Types
TypeScript provides various data types to help developers catch errors during development. These include primitive types like `number`, `string`, and `boolean`, as well as more complex types like arrays, tuples, and enums. The `any` type is also available for variables that can hold any type of value, useful in situations where the type is not known in advance.

## Interfaces
Interfaces in TypeScript define the structure of an object, ensuring that the object adheres to a specific shape. They are a powerful way to define contracts within your code, enabling better type checking and code completion.

## Functions
Functions in TypeScript can have typed parameters and return types, providing more control and safety. Functions also support optional and default parameters, making them flexible and robust. This helps in defining clear interfaces for function inputs and outputs.

## Classes
TypeScript offers a full-featured class system, including inheritance, access modifiers, and other object-oriented principles. Classes enable the creation of reusable and maintainable code structures, allowing for clear and organized code design.

## Decorators
Decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class, method, accessor, property, or parameter. They are used to modify the behavior of these entities, enabling meta-programming capabilities and enhancing the functionality of your code.


Happy Coding!
